The apparatus is constructed with this object in view, but the safety of the trains\ndepends largely upon the careful observance of the regulations. The Signal-cabins at which the Block Telegraph Working\nis in operation, are furnished with Instruments to signal for each Line of rails, and the System under which the\napparatus works is described in the following Regulations. These must be strictly observed.\nAll Fixed Signals must be kept at DANGER, except when it is necessary to lower them for a train to pass, and before\nany Signal is lowered, care must be taken to ascertain that the Line is clear, and that the Block Telegraph and other\nRegulations have been carried out for the train.\nWhen the Block Instruments are not in use the Indicators must be kept vertical; the indicators will then hang vertically,\nand when in that position will indicate LINE BLOCKED, and this position of the Indicators must be regarded as\nindicating LINE BLOCKED.\nThe movements on the Block Instruments and Bell must be made slowly and distinctly, and the pauses between the\nsets of beats clearly marked.\n\nUP LINE.\nDIAGRAMS\nOF\nALS.\nBELL SIGNALS.\nLINE\nCLEAR\nTRAIN\nON\nLINE\nLINE\nBLOCKED\n\nDOWN LINE.\nLINE\nCLEAR\nTRAIN\nON\nLINE\nLINE\nBLOCKED\nDIAL SIGNALS.\n\nNo. of\nBell beats. | Call Attention | How to be given.\n1 | Signal repeatedly repeated | 1\n2 | Calling Attention. | 1\n3 | Train entering Section. | 2\n4 | Train out of Section and the train out of section signal given. | 3\n5 | Obstruction removed | 4\n6 | Line clear after Blocking Back. | 5\n7 | Is Line clear for Express Passenger Train, break-down Van Train, or Light Engine? | 6\n8 | Is Line clear for Ordinary Passenger Train? | 7\n9 | Is Line clear for Ordinary Goods, Mineral, or Ballast Train? | 8\n10 | Is the Block Instrument in working order? | 9\n11 | Train has passed without Tail Lamp. | 10\n12 | Ballast Train requiring to stop in Section? | 11\n13 | Light Engine, or two Light Engines, or Engine and not more than two vehicles following. | 12\n14 | Cattles, or other Train requiring to stop in Section, or Plate layers' Lorry going through to next Signal Box? | 13\n15 | Obstruction danger signal to be given. | 14\n16 | Fire, or Obstruction to be given. | 15\n17 | Stop and Examine Train. | 16\n18 | Caution. | 17\n19 | Blocking Back for Passenger Trains. | 18\n20 | Blocking Back except for Passenger Trains. | 19\n21 | Line Clear after Blocking Back | 20\n22 | Cancelling Signal. | 21\n\nNo. of\nBell beats. | Signal repeatedly repeated | How to be given.\n1 | Express Passenger Train, break-down Van Train, or Train going to the Siding, or Light Engine going to an Intermediate Siding. | 1\n2 | Ordinary Passenger Train; or Ordinary Passenger Train, break-down Van Train NOT going to clear the Line? | 1\n3 | Ordinary Goods, Mineral, or Ballast Train, composed of Coaching Stock. | 3\n4 | Fire, or Obstruction to be given. | 4\n5 | Obstruction removed | 5\n6 | Line clear for Express Passenger Train, break-down Van Train, or Light Engine. | 6\n7 | Ordinary Passenger Train, or Light Engine. | 7\n8 | Ordinary Goods, Mineral, or Ballast Train. | 8\n9 | Is the Block Instrument in working order? | 9\n10 | Train has passed without Tail Lamp. | 10\n11 | Ballast Train requiring to stop in Section? | 11\n12 | Light Engine, or two Light Engines, or Engine and not more than two vehicles following. | 12\n13 | Cattles, or other Train requiring to stop in Section, or Platelavers' Lorry going through to next Signal Box? | 13\n14 | Obstruction danger signal to be given. | 14\n15 | Fire, or Obstruction to be given. | 15\n16 | Stop and Examine Train. | 16\n17 | Caution. | 17\n18 | Blocking Back for Passenger Trains. | 18\n19 | Blocking Back except for Passenger Trains. | 19\n20 | Line Clear after Blocking Back. | 20\n\n1.\u2014Call Attention. The Call attention signal must at once and in the first place precede every other signal, except where\nit is stated that no Call attention signal is to be given. After the Call attention signal has been given, it must be\nanswered by the Signalman in the next Signal-box repeating it. If the Call attention signal is not answered, the\nSignalman must not send the next signal, but must again give the Call attention signal, and if this be not then\nanswered, the Block instruments must be put to \"Line Blocked,\" and the Signals applicable to the Line on which\nthe attention is required must be kept at \"Danger,\" and steps taken for protecting the Line in the direction from which\nthe train is approaching, as provided in Rule 77.\n2.\u2014Repetition and Acknowledgment of Signals.\u2014Except where an acknowledgement is specially provided for by\nthese Regulations, every signal sent on the Block Telegraph Instruments must be at once repeated by the Signalman\nto whom it is sent, and the Signalman sending it must acknowledge the signal by again giving it once, after which\nit must be taken as correct, and if any Signalman should transmit an incorrect signal, he must immediately on discovering\nhis error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the section.\n3.\u2014Mode of Signalling by Block Telegraph.\u2014A. A Train having passed the Home Signal of an ordinary Signal-box, the\n\"Train entering Section\" signal must be given to the Signalman in advance, and the \"Train on Line\" indicator put to\n\"Train on Line.\" As soon as the train has passed the Home Signal of the Signal-box in advance, the Signalman in\nthat Box must give the \"Train out of Section\" signal, and the \"Line Clear\" indicator put to \"Line Clear.\" This\nmovement must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations. When the \"Line clear\" signal is given,\nit must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\n4.\u2014Line Clear, or giving Permission for a Train to Approach.\u2014If an express passenger train is about to be sent\nfrom one Signal Box to another, the Signalman must first ascertain that the Line is clear for the whole of the distance\nbetween the two Boxes. The Signalman must then give the \"Line clear\" signal, which must be repeated by the\nSignalman in the next Box. If the \"Line clear\" signal is not repeated, the Signalman must again give the \"Line clear\"\nsignal, and if this be not then answered, the Block instruments must be put to \"Line Blocked,\" and the Signals applicable\nto the Line on which the attention is required must be kept at \"Danger,\" and steps taken for protecting the Line in the\ndirection from which the train is approaching, as provided in Rule 77.\n\n5.\u2014At Junctions.\u2014When, where advisable, the approach of trains can be observed by the Signalman in the next Box,\nhe must give the \"Line clear\" signal, and if this be not then answered, the Block instruments must be put to \"Line Blocked,\"\nand the Signals applicable to the Line on which the attention is required must be kept at \"Danger,\" and steps taken for\nprotecting the Line in the direction from which the train is approaching, as provided in Rule 77.\nJUNCTION\nMAIN LINE\nBRANCH LINE\nHOME\nSIGNAL\nDOWN\nLINE\nUP LINE\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations. When the \"Line clear\" signal is given,\nit must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\n6.\u2014Description of Trains.\u2014When the \"Line clear\" signal has been given for an express passenger train, it must be\nrepeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on discovering\nhis error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must again\ngive the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually out of\nthe Section.\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations. When the \"Line clear\" signal is given,\nit must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\n7.\u2014Train Entering Section.\u2014The \"Train entering Section\" signal must be given when the train has arrived at the next\nBox, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on discovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as\nsoon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must again give the correct signal.

    "Q9_Transcription": "NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY.\nREGULATIONS FOR TRAIN SIGNALLING by Block Telegraph System on Double Lines of Railway.\nIN OPERATION FROM 1.0 P.M., SUNDAY, 1 th MARCH, 1896.\n\nThe object of the system of Block Telegraph Signalling is to prevent more than one train being in the Section between\nBlock Signalcabins on the same Line at the same time, and to keep following trains apart by an interval of not less\nthan one Clear Section or Block. The apparatus is constructed with this object in view, but the safety of the trains\ndepends largely upon the careful observance of the regulations. The Signal-cabins at which the Block Telegraph Working\nis in operation, are furnished with Instruments to signal for each Line of rails, and the System under which the\napparatus works is described in the following Regulations. These must be strictly observed.\nAll Fixed Signals must be kept at DANGER, except when it is necessary to lower them for a train to pass, and before\nany Signal is lowered, care must be taken to ascertain that the Line is clear, and that the Block Telegraph and other\nRegulations have been carried out for the train.\nWhen the Block Instruments are not in use the Indicators must be kept vertical; the indicators will then hang vertically,\nand when in that position will indicate LINE BLOCKED, and this position of the Indicators must be regarded as\nindicating LINE BLOCKED.\nThe movements on the Block Instruments and Bell must be made slowly and distinctly, and the pauses between the\nsets of beats clearly marked.\n\nUP LINE.\nDIAGRAMS\nOF\nALS.\nBELL SIGNALS.\nLINE\nCLEAR\nTRAIN\nON\nLINE\nLINE\nBLOCKED\n\nDOWN LINE.\nLINE\nCLEAR\nTRAIN\nON\nLINE\nLINE\nBLOCKED\nDIAL SIGNALS.\n\nNo. of\nBell beats. | Call Attention | How to be given.\n1 | Signal repeatedly repeated | 1\n2 | Calling Attention. | 1\n3 | Train entering Section. | 2\n4 | Train out of Section and the train out of section signal given. | 3\n5 | Obstruction removed | 4\n6 | Line clear after Blocking Back. | 5\n7 | Is Line clear for Express Passenger Train, break-down Van Train, or Light Engine? | 6\n8 | Is Line clear for Ordinary Passenger Train? | 7\n9 | Is Line clear for Ordinary Goods, Mineral, or Ballast Train? | 8\n10 | Is the Block Instrument in working order? | 9\n11 | Train has passed without Tail Lamp. | 10\n12 | Ballast Train requiring to stop in Section? | 11\n13 | Light Engine, or two Light Engines, or Engine and not more than two vehicles following. | 12\n14 | Cattles, or other Train requiring to stop in Section, or Plate layers' Lorry going through to next Signal Box? | 13\n15 | Obstruction danger signal to be given. | 14\n16 | Fire, or Obstruction to be given. | 15\n17 | Stop and Examine Train. | 16\n18 | Caution. | 17\n19 | Blocking Back for Passenger Trains. | 18\n20 | Blocking Back except for Passenger Trains. | 19\n21 | Line Clear after Blocking Back | 20\n22 | Cancelling Signal. | 21\n\nNo. of\nBell beats. | Signal repeatedly repeated | How to be given.\n1 | Express Passenger Train, break-down Van Train, or Train going to the Siding, or Light Engine going to an Intermediate Siding. | 1\n2 | Ordinary Passenger Train; or Ordinary Passenger Train, break-down Van Train NOT going to clear the Line? | 1\n3 | Ordinary Goods, Mineral, or Ballast Train, composed of Coaching Stock. | 3\n4 | Fire, or Obstruction to be given. | 4\n5 | Obstruction removed | 5\n6 | Line clear for Express Passenger Train, break-down Van Train, or Light Engine. | 6\n7 | Ordinary Passenger Train, or Light Engine. | 7\n8 | Ordinary Goods, Mineral, or Ballast Train. | 8\n9 | Is the Block Instrument in working order? | 9\n10 | Train has passed without Tail Lamp. | 10\n11 | Ballast Train requiring to stop in Section? | 11\n12 | Light Engine, or two Light Engines, or Engine and not more than two vehicles following. | 12\n13 | Cattles, or other Train requiring to stop in Section, or Platelavers' Lorry going through to next Signal Box? | 13\n14 | Obstruction danger signal to be given. | 14\n15 | Fire, or Obstruction to be given. | 15\n16 | Stop and Examine Train. | 16\n17 | Caution. | 17\n18 | Blocking Back for Passenger Trains. | 18\n19 | Blocking Back except for Passenger Trains. | 19\n20 | Line Clear after Blocking Back. | 20\n\n1.\u2014Call Attention. The Call attention signal must at once and in the first place precede every other signal, except where\nit is stated that no Call attention signal is to be given. After the Call attention signal has been given, it must be\nanswered by the Signalman in the next Signal-box repeating it. If the Call attention signal is not answered, the\nSignalman must not send the next signal, but must again give the Call attention signal, and if this be not then\nanswered, the Block instruments must be put to \"Line Blocked,\" and the Signals applicable to the Line on which\nthe attention is required must be kept at \"Danger,\" and steps taken for protecting the Line in the direction from which\nthe train is approaching, as provided in Rule 77.\n2.\u2014Repetition and Acknowledgment of Signals.\u2014Except where an acknowledgement is specially provided for by\nthese Regulations, every signal sent on the Block Telegraph Instruments must be at once repeated by the Signalman\nto whom it is sent, and the Signalman sending it must acknowledge the signal by again giving it once, after which\nit must be taken as correct, and if any Signalman should transmit an incorrect signal, he must immediately on discovering\nhis error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the section.\n3.\u2014Mode of Signalling by Block Telegraph.\u2014A. A Train having passed the Home Signal of an ordinary Signal-box, the\n\"Train entering Section\" signal must be given to the Signalman in advance, and the \"Train on Line\" indicator put to\n\"Train on Line.\" As soon as the train has passed the Home Signal of the Signal-box in advance, the Signalman in\nthat Box must give the \"Train out of Section\" signal, and the \"Line Clear\" indicator put to \"Line Clear.\" This\nmovement must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations. When the \"Line clear\" signal is given,\nit must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\n4.\u2014Line Clear, or giving Permission for a Train to Approach.\u2014If an express passenger train is about to be sent\nfrom one Signal Box to another, the Signalman must first ascertain that the Line is clear for the whole of the distance\nbetween the two Boxes. The Signalman must then give the \"Line clear\" signal, which must be repeated by the\nSignalman in the next Box. If the \"Line clear\" signal is not repeated, the Signalman must again give the \"Line clear\"\nsignal, and if this be not then answered, the Block instruments must be put to \"Line Blocked,\" and the Signals applicable\nto the Line on which the attention is required must be kept at \"Danger,\" and steps taken for protecting the Line in the\ndirection from which the train is approaching, as provided in Rule 77.\n\n5.\u2014At Junctions.\u2014When, where advisable, the approach of trains can be observed by the Signalman in the next Box,\nhe must give the \"Line clear\" signal, and if this be not then answered, the Block instruments must be put to \"Line Blocked,\"\nand the Signals applicable to the Line on which the attention is required must be kept at \"Danger,\" and steps taken for\nprotecting the Line in the direction from which the train is approaching, as provided in Rule 77.\nJUNCTION\nMAIN LINE\nBRANCH LINE\nHOME\nSIGNAL\nDOWN\nLINE\nUP LINE\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations. When the \"Line clear\" signal is given,\nit must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\n6.\u2014Description of Trains.\u2014When the \"Line clear\" signal has been given for an express passenger train, it must be\nrepeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on discovering\nhis error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must again\ngive the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually out of\nthe Section.\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations. When the \"Line clear\" signal is given,\nit must be repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on\ndiscovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as soon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must\nagain give the correct signal. In no case must the \"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually\nout of the Section.\n7.\u2014Train Entering Section.\u2014The \"Train entering Section\" signal must be given when the train has arrived at the next\nBox, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on discovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as\nsoon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must again give the correct signal. In no case must the\n\"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually out of the Section.\n8.\u2014Train Out of Section.\u2014The \"Train out of Section\" signal must be given when the train has arrived at the next\nBox, and if he requires to send a train, he must immediately on discovering his error give the Cancelling Signal, and as\nsoon as it is repeated by the Signalman in the next Box, he must again give the correct signal. In no case must the\n\"Train out of Section\" signal be given until the train is actually out of the Section.\nWhen a train is sent from one station to another, the Line is said to be \"Clear\" when all the Signals are at \"Danger,\"\nand the Line is clear for the whole of the distance between the two stations.
