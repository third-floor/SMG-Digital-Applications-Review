    "brief bio": "(1792-1871) 1st Baronet, astronomer\n\nJohn Herschel, the only child of Sir William Herschel, an astronomer, was born on the 7th March 1792 in Slough, Buckinghamshire. He was educated briefly at Eton and then at Dr Gretton's private school at Hitcham. In 1809 he entered St John's College, Cambridge in the company of Charles Babbage, mathematician and inventor of the computer, and George Peacock, also a mathematician and later a theologian. In 1812 they founded the Analytical Society of Cambridge. Herschel graduated in 1813 as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman and was soon elected to a fellowship at St John's. In May 1813 the Royal Society elected him to membership.\n\nIn 1814 Herschel was admitted to Lincoln's Inn to prepare for the bar but he was not happy with his choice and left his studies in the summer of 1815. He returned to Cambridge as a sub-lector but, finding himself dissatisfied with 'pupillizing', he left in 1816, to assist his renowned father in astronomical research. Through his work with his father, he gained the full benefit of the aged astronomer\u2019s unrivalled experience in the construction and use of large telescopes. This apprenticeship laid the foundation of John\u2019s subsequent achievements. In 1820 he was among the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society. In later years, John made important contributions to mathematics, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1821.\n\nHerschel\u2019s first major task in astronomy was the re-observation of the double stars catalogued by his father. The movements of these pairs of stars about each other offered the best hope of investigating the gravitational forces operating in the universe. John was fortunate to find in James South a collaborator who was able to afford the refined instruments best suited for this work. The catalogue that they compiled between 1821 and 1823 and published in the Philosophical Transactions in 1824 earned them the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Lalande Prize in 1825 from the Paris Academy of Sciences. Herschel served as secretary of the Royal Society in 1824\u201327. He married in 1829 and in 1831 he was knighted.\n\nHerschel\u2019s sense of obligation to complete his father\u2019s work in astronomy led him to the Southern Hemisphere to survey the skies not visible in England. In 1832 he began planning his expedition. The revision and extension of his father\u2019s catalogues, which he carried out at Observatory House, beginning in 1825, was brought to completion and published in 1833. In November of that year, John and his family set sail for the Cape of Good Hope with a large reflecting telescope for observing faint nebulae, similar in size to William\u2019s favourite instrument. He also possessed a refracting telescope for observing double stars. The family established their home at Feldhausen, southeast of Cape Town where John spent four years carrying out intense scientific activity. When the family embarked for home in March of 1838, John had recorded the locations of 68,948 stars and had amassed long catalogues of nebulae and double stars. He had also described many details of the Great Nebula in the constellation Orion, as well as the Magellanic Clouds\u2014actually two galaxies best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere\u2014and had observed Halley\u2019s Comet and the satellites of Saturn. In addition, his descriptions of sunspot activities and his measuring of solar radiation by means of a device he had invented contributed to the development of systematic studies of the Sun as an important part of astrophysics. Upon his return he was made a baronet (1838) and was lionized by the scientific world.\n\nHerschel was also a highly accomplished chemist. His discovery in 1819 of the solvent power of hyposulfite of soda on the otherwise insoluble salts of silver was the prelude to its use as a fixing agent in photography; and he invented in 1839, independently of Fox Talbot, the process of photography on sensitized paper. He was the first person to apply the now well-known terms \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d to photographic images, and to imprint them upon glass prepared by the deposit of a sensitive film.\n\nDuring the 1840s Herschel worked on Outlines of Astronomy (1849), a book for educated laymen. This very successful science text went through many editions, including Arabic and Chinese. But the bulk of his time was occupied with the Results of Astronomical Observations, Made During the Years 1834\u201338 at the Cape of Good Hope (1847). This work contains catalogues and charts of southern-sky nebulae and star clusters, a catalogue of the relative positions and magnitudes of southern double stars, and his observations on the variations and relative brightness of the stars.\n\nAt the end of 1850, Herschel was appointed master of the Mint, a position once held by Isaac Newton. Herschel died at Collingwood on 11 May 1871. Bronchial problems, which had beset him for many years, were probably the main cause of his death.",

    "brief bio": "(1802-1875) Knight Physicist\n\nSir Charles Wheatstone, developer of telegraphy, was born on the 6th February 1802 at the Manor House, Barnwood, Gloucester. In 1806 the family moved to London, where Wheatstone went to school. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to an uncle, who had a musical instrument manufacturing business in the Strand. Charles was fascinated by the physics of sound and in 1823 -the same year he took over his Uncle's business with his younger brother William -he contributed to a paper 'Thomson's Annals of Philosophy', describing his early experiments with sound.  In 1825 he constructed a mouth organ with free reeds governed by a small button keyboard; further experiments led to the bellows-blown concertina (patent 10,041 of 1844). One of the few original British musical instrument designs, it is still being played at the present time. \n\nWheatstone made several important contributions to optics, the stereoscope, was entirely due to Wheatstone. When David Brewster discovered that light from the sky is always polarized in a plane 90\u00b0 from the sun, Wheatstone devised a clock by which it was possible to tell the hour of the day by the light from the sky even though the sun might be invisible. Although his inventions in other branches of science are numerous, Wheatstone has been most closely connected with the electric telegraph. He was not the \u2018inventor\u2019, but Wheatstone, with his collaborator William Fothergill Cooke, is due the credit for having been the first to render it available for the public transmission of messages. In 1834, at about the time he was appointed professor of experimental philosophy at King's College, London, Wheatstone began experimenting on the rate of transmission of electricity along wires. From this research Wheatstone passed on to the transmission of messages by electricity, and, in conjunction with Cooke, he devised the five-needle telegraph, and then the two-needle telegraph, the first that came into general use. This led to many new developments, including the letter-showing dial telegraph in 1840, and the type-printing telegraph in 1841. The automatic transmitting and receiving instruments, by which messages were sent with great rapidity over the telegraph system, were designed by Wheatstone alone, after the partnership with Cooke had been dissolved. \n\nFrom 1837 Wheatstone devoted a good deal of time to submarine telegraphy, and in 1844 experiments were made in Swansea Bay, with the assistance of J. D. Llewellyn. In 1837 he devised a method of combining several armatures on one shaft so as to generate a continuous current. Wheatstone had many miscellaneous inventions including a share in the development of the electric generator, electro-magnetic clocks for indicating time at any number of different places united on a circuit, a cryptograph, or secret dispatch writer, which was used by the British army, electric chronographs, apparatus for making instruments record automatically, and instruments for measuring electricity and electrical resistance, including the rheostat. It was he who called attention to Christy's combination of wires, commonly known as \u2018Wheatstone's bridge\u2019, in which an electric balancing of the currents is obtained, and he worked out its application to electrical measurement. He was one of the first in Britain to appreciate the importance of Ohm's simple law of the relation between electromotive force, resistance of conductors, and resulting current\u2014the law which is the foundation of all electrical engineering. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1836.\n\nWheatstone married, on 12 February 1847, they had a family of two sons and three daughters.

He continued his studies in London and passed his examinations, becoming a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1852. He was recommended to visit Professor of Clinical Surgery James Syme (1799-1870) in Edinburgh and became his dresser and later his house surgeon.

He read Pasteur's work on micro-organisms and decided to experiment with using one of Pasteur's proposed techniques, that of exposing the wound to chemicals. He chose dressings soaked with carbolic acid (phenol) to cover the wound and the rate of infection was vastly reduced.

    "brief bio": "Sir William Fairbairn was born at Kelso, Scotland, in 1789. He was the son of a farmer. His initial schooling was at the local parish school where he learnt to read and studied arithmetic. He later studied book keeping under the guidance of his uncle.\n\nThe family moved frequently to farms in North Scotland, North Yorkshire and Tyneside. In 1803, while living in Knaresborough, Fairbairn took his first job working on a bridge being built by John Rennie. He was injured in an accident. Later that year, the family moved to a farm belonging to Percy Main colliery, near Newcastle upon Tyne. Fairbairn began working at the colliery and, in 1804, he was apprenticed to John Robinson, a millwright. Fairbairn's technical ability led to him being appointed to look after the engines at Percy Main colliery. Here he became acquainted with George Stephenson. Fairbairn later worked with Stephenson's son Robert on the Britannia and Conway bridges over the Menai Strait.\n\nIn March 1811, Fairbairn finished his apprenticeship and found work as a millwright in Newcastle. In December that year, he moved to London where he met Alexander Tillotson, the founder of the Philosophical Magazine. Tillotson was building a steam shovel and employed Fairbairn in its construction. By June 1816 he had moved again to Manchester and started to work on a replacement for the Blackfriars Bridge across the River Irwell. Following a disagreement with his employer, Fairbairn left the project and entered into a partnership with James Lillie, with whom he had previously worked as a millwright. Fairbairn and Lillie's first job was to supply machinery to a cotton mill. Their success in this venture meant that the company expanded rapidly, diversifying into the erection of watermills and the construction of light iron steam ships. A heavy loss in the cotton mill project resulted in Fairbairn and Lillie dissolving the partnership in 1832. Fairbairn concentrated on building light iron ships, initially in Manchester. He moved the business to Millwall, London, in 1835, entering into a partnership with an old pupil, Andrew Murray. In 1844 he abandoned the partnership and left Millwall to return to Manchester.\n\nThe decline of the cotton industry in Manchester meant that Fairbairn's skills as a millwright were in low demand. He diversified into other areas of engineering and began working with John Hetherington on the Lancashire Boiler. Fairbairn also experimented with the properties of iron, and introduced a riveting machine into the boiler making process, to counteract the effects of a strike by his workforce.\n\nAs well as designing and manufacturing boilers, Fairbairn was interested in safety at work, particularly the prevention of accidents caused by machinery. He initiated a boiler inspection service in response to the high numbers of people being killed or injured as a result of boiler explosions. This led to the establishment of the Manchester Steam Users\u2019 Association in 1854, the same year that Fairbairn was elected president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nFairbairn was also president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society from 1855 to 1860. He was an authority on mechanical engineering and published many works, including a handbook for engineers in 1856, an examination of the properties of iron in 1861, and a treatise on mills between 1861 and 1863.\n\nHaving turned down a knighthood in 1861, Fairbairn became a Baronet in 1869. He lived in Ardwick from 1840 until his death in 1874.",
