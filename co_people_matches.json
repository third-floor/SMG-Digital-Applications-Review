About this time, however, the Admiralty was forming the Board of Invention and Research (BIR).

As a boy Trotter lived with his mother and four sisters at 40 Montagu Square, London, and attended local schools. He then went to Harrow School but did not enjoy it. Trotter spent a year at King's College, London, then a period with a private tutor named Fletcher, preparing for the entrance examination for Trinity College, Cambridge. At King's he gained practical experience of carpentry in the college's excellent workshop. With Fletcher he learned practical photography, making his own glass-plate negatives. Having passed the entrance examination, he entered Trinity in 1876, taking the natural sciences tripos, and graduated BA in 1879. Trotter took an engineering apprenticeship with Easton and Anderson at Erith, Kent. By this time both his parents had died, leaving him about \u00a35000. His brother William, a stockbroker, 'overhauled' his investments and produced the 500 guinea fee for the apprenticeship.\n\nIn 1881, Trotter attended the first International Electrical Exhibition in Paris, from which he said marked the birth of electrical engineering; from that time on, his main professional interest was electric lighting. In 1883 Trotter went into partnership with W. T. Goolden, at Halifax, as a manufacturer of electric dynamos. The partnership ended in 1887 when he returned to London. In 1890 he became editor of The Electrician, a post he held until 1896, when he moved to South Africa as electrical adviser to the government of Cape Colony. In 1899 he returned to London and succeeded Philip Cardew as electrical adviser to the Board of Trade, where he played a major part in drafting electricity legislation and regulations and conducted inquiries for the board.\n\nOn retiring from the Board of Trade in 1917, Trotter joined H. W. Handcock and A. H. Dykes in their consulting engineering practice, but he retired again after two and a half years. He moved to Teffont, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, and continued to be actively involved in electric lighting. He was a founder member of the Illuminating Engineering Society, established in 1909, active in its committees, and president from 1917 to 1920. He gave the second Faraday lecture, on 'Illumination and light', in 1926.\n\nTrotter presented extensive manuscript reminiscences to the Institution of Electrical Engineers. In 1886 he married Alys Fane Keatinge, they had one son, Nigel, killed in the First World War, and one daughter, Gunda. He died of heart failure at his home, Greystones, Teffont, on 23 July 1947.",

As a boy Trotter lived with his mother and four sisters at 40 Montagu Square, London, and attended local schools. He then went to Harrow School but did not enjoy it. Trotter spent a year at King's College, London, then a period with a private tutor named Fletcher, preparing for the entrance examination for Trinity College, Cambridge. At King's he gained practical experience of carpentry in the college's excellent workshop. With Fletcher he learned practical photography, making his own glass-plate negatives. Having passed the entrance examination, he entered Trinity in 1876, taking the natural sciences tripos, and graduated BA in 1879. Trotter took an engineering apprenticeship with Easton and Anderson at Erith, Kent. By this time both his parents had died, leaving him about \u00a35000. His brother William, a stockbroker, 'overhauled' his investments and produced the 500 guinea fee for the apprenticeship.\n\nIn 1881, Trotter attended the first International Electrical Exhibition in Paris, from which he said marked the birth of electrical engineering; from that time on, his main professional interest was electric lighting. In 1883 Trotter went into partnership with W. T. Goolden, at Halifax, as a manufacturer of electric dynamos. The partnership ended in 1887 when he returned to London. In 1890 he became editor of The Electrician, a post he held until 1896, when he moved to South Africa as electrical adviser to the government of Cape Colony. In 1899 he returned to London and succeeded Philip Cardew as electrical adviser to the Board of Trade, where he played a major part in drafting electricity legislation and regulations and conducted inquiries for the board.\n\nOn retiring from the Board of Trade in 1917, Trotter joined H. W. Handcock and A. H. Dykes in their consulting engineering practice, but he retired again after two and a half years. He moved to Teffont, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, and continued to be actively involved in electric lighting. He was a founder member of the Illuminating Engineering Society, established in 1909, active in its committees, and president from 1917 to 1920. He gave the second Faraday lecture, on 'Illumination and light', in 1926.\n\nTrotter presented extensive manuscript reminiscences to the Institution of Electrical Engineers. In 1886 he married Alys Fane Keatinge, they had one son, Nigel, killed in the First World War, and one daughter, Gunda. He died of heart failure at his home, Greystones, Teffont, on 23 July 1947. ; birth.date[0].from: 1857.0 ; death.date[0].from: 1947.0\n\nRespond only with yes, no or unclear first.

Barba's resulting treaty, the Art of Metals, was published in Madrid in 1640. It contained a detailed description of the silver wealth in Bolivia, as well as a fundamental discovery for the exploitation of extracting silver known as the scoop method.  The innovation introduced by this method lay in the use of copper scoops instead of iron. The Art of Metals was translated into several languages and acheived increasing prominence in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nBarba returned to Spain in 1657, where he implemented his discoveries in the silver deposits of Niebla, Huelva. \n\nBarba died in Seville in 1662.",

He spent time touring the province of Charcas in Bolivia, known for its gold, silver and copper mines. \n\nThe president of the Audiencia de Charcas, Juan de Lizarazu,, became aware of Barba's knowledge and sought his transfer to the curate of San Bernardo in Potos\u00ed, where he asked him for a treaty that systematized the metallurgical processes carried out in the area. Barba's resulting treaty, the Art of Metals, was published in Madrid in 1640. It contained a detailed description of the silver wealth in Bolivia, as well as a fundamental discovery for the exploitation of extracting silver known as the scoop method.  The innovation introduced by this method lay in the use of copper scoops instead of iron. The Art of Metals was translated into several languages and acheived increasing prominence in the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nBarba returned to Spain in 1657, where he implemented his discoveries in the silver deposits of Niebla, Huelva. \n\nBarba died in Seville in 1662. ; birth.date[0].from: 1569.0 ; death.date[0].from: 1662.0\n\nRespond only with yes, no or unclear first.

    "description[0].value.1": "The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran\u00e7ais (SNCF) is the French National Railway Company and was formed by a decree from the French Government on 31st August 1937. This was to take over the operation of the French Railway system from the four existing private companies, Chemins de fer de l\u2019Est (Est), Chemins de fer du Nord (Nord), Chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Lyon et \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (PLM) and Chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans et du Midi (PO-Midi) and the railways already controlled by the state under the Chemins de fer de l\u2019\u00c9tat (\u00c9tat). \n\nSNCF took over control of the French Railway system from 1st January 1938. Upon creation, it became responsible for 42,700 km of railway, 8% of which was electrified, run by 515,000 workers.  At this time, it was controlled by the French Government, who owned 51% of the shares, and the private railway companies, who between them owned 49%. The board was formed of the Vice President of the Council of State, the Governor of the Bank of France, the Director of Caisse des Dep\u00f4ts et Consignations, 12 representatives of the State, 12 nominees of the private railway companies, four members appointed by railwaymen, and two who had rendered eminent railway service. The operation of SNCF was divided into five regions, which corresponded to the private companies, Northern, Nord, Eastern, Est, South Eastern, PLM, South Western, PO-Midi, and Western, \u00c9tat. Each of the regions was controlled by a regional manager who reported to the general manager. Each of the regions has its own operating, rolling stock and way and works departments. \n\nFollowing the Second World War SNCF embarked on a program of five-year plans in order to recover from the damage and to modernise the system. In 1966 a research service was created and in 1981 the first Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse (TGV) was introduced between Paris and Lyon.\n\nIn 1982 SNCF ceased to exist as a nationalised company, as it had been since creation in 1937, and was restructured in line with the Loi d\u2019orientation des transports int\u00e9rieurs, the law on internal transport policy. This handed the company over to complete state ownership, removing the stake that had been controlled by the predecessor companies. Under the new structure SNCF became a Public Industry and Commercial Establishment with increased state control. The board now consisted of seven state representatives, six members elected by staff and five others. Also, a contract between the government and SNCF, the Contrat de Plan, which set out the strategic objectives and statutory relationship and was renewed every five years, was created. This limited passenger fares, laid out SNCF responsibilities to working conditions and set out what government subsidies would be and where they would be spent, debt elimination, services, infrastructure etc. The restructuring did not eliminate the 12 billion Franc debt the company had accrued. \n\nFollowing the 1982 restructuring the regional structure of SNCF was replaced with sectors. Passenger services were split into Intercity, Regional, later rebranded in 1987 as Transport Express Regional (TER) and Pairs Suburban, while Freight services were set up as an individual sector. Several subsidiaries were also formed including SERNAM, parcels, Servirail, catering, SGW, wagon hire, CNC, container service, and Cariane, coach and bus services. \n\nIn 1997 R\u00e9seau Ferr\u00e9 National, later known as R\u00e9seau Ferr\u00e9 de France (RFF), was created as a state owned Industrial and Commercial Enterprise. This was responsible for developing and improving the French rail network with the work being carried out by SNCF under RFF guidance. It also took over all state-owned infrastructure controlled by SNCF but not used in operating transport services. In 1999 SNCF launched a partnership with the Paris transport association known as Transilien SNCF. This was designed to improve the quality and usability of Paris suburban services.\n\nIn 2015 the Rail Reform Act again restructured SNCF by creating the SNCF Group. This is a unified public service company which consists of three states owned Industrial and Commercial Enterprises, SNCF, SNCF R\u00e9seau and SNCF Mobilit\u00e9s, which operate five core businesses. SNCF manages the property and land owned by the group under the business name SNCF Immobilier. SNCF R\u00e9seau manages the infrastructure network, traffic, expansion and maintenance in France as well as providing guidance for systems in other counties. SNCF Mobilit\u00e9s is made up of three business areas. These are SNCF Voyageurs, Keolis and SNCF Logistics. SNCF Voyageurs operates passenger trains in France consisting of Transilien, public transport in the Paris region, TER, regional services, Intercit\u00e9s, intercity services, and Voyages SNCF, high speed services, domestic long-distance services and international services. SNCF Voyageurs is also responsible for station management. Keolis manages public transport in France and internationally. SNCF Logistics is made up of Geodis, which operates freight transport in France and internationally, TFMM, which operates rail and multimodal freight transport, Ermewa Group, which is responsible for leasing rail equipment, and STVA, which operates auto and vehicle logistics. In this form SNCF is controlled by a supervisory board with each Industrial and Commercial Enterprise having its own board. \n\nAs of 2016 SNCF operated 30,000 km of railways in France with 2,000 km of this being high speed lines and 14,500 km electrified. The group employs 260,000 people with 155,000 working in France.",

Founded in 1923, the Southern Railway took over the railways of South-East England and came to consist of five major railway companies and 14 small ones. The Southern Railway had works at Ashford, Brighton, Lancing and Eastleigh.  \n\nThe first chairman of the Southern Railway was Brigadier-General Sir Hugh Drummond. Initially the general managers of the three main constituent companies, namely the London & South Western Railway (LSWR), London, Brighton & South Coast Railway (LBSCR) and South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) worked together to lead the Southern Railway during its first year of operation. From 1 January 1924 it was decided that railway would be led by one general manager and one chief mechanical engineer. The first holders of these posts were Sir Herbert Ashcombe Walker, formerly manager of the LSWR and Richard Maunsell previously the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SECR. Walker was succeeded by Gilbert Szlumper, then Sir Eustace Missenden and the last general manager prior to nationalisation was Sir John Elliott. \n\nThe Southern Railway's operating structure was based on geographical divisions, initially these were London (East), London (West), Eastern (Dover) Southern (Brighton), Central (Southampton), and Western (Exeter). \n\nThe Southern Railway was the smallest of the Big Four, and it relied primarily on passenger traffic. The Southern Railway\u2019s predecessors had begun the process of electrification around suburban London where there was a high volume of passenger traffic. This programme was continued by the Southern Railway and was approved by its first AGM in March 1924. A rolling programme of electrification continued throughout Southern Railway\u2019s operation, and on 30 December 1932 the newly electrified line to Brighton was opened. Despite Southern Railway\u2019s increasing use of electric trains, steam locomotives continued to be used, especially for goods trains, until the nationalisation of the railways in 1948.  \n\nAs well as operating rail traffic, the Southern Railway owned and operated docks and harbours along the South Coast, the most important of which was Southampton Docks. It also ran passenger steamers across the English Channel to France. The Southern Railway operated air services to the Channel Islands from a number of airfields in the South-East and had stations at these airfields to allow passengers to transfer.  \n   \nThe 1947 Transport Act nationalised the railways, and the Southern Railway came to be run by the Railway Executive as part of the new British Transport Commission.

George Stephenson was appointed engineer in January 1822 to see to the survey and the building of the line, he also supplied the first locomotives which were built be his son, Robert Stephenson.\n\nIn May 1825 Timothy Hackworth was appointed locomotive foreman and worked with the company for eight years and designed a type of locomotive more suitable for coal traffic, with six-coupled wheels.\n\nMost of the branches and extensions to the Stockton and Darlington Railway were built by separate companies, although worked by the S&DR, however most of these companies were taken over by S&DR in 1858.\n\nIn 1863 the Stockton & Darlington Railway ceased to exist as a separate concern, but until 1876 it was run as the Darlington section of the North Eastern Railway. ; birth.date[0].from:  ; death.date[0].from: \n\nRespond only with yes, no or unclear first.

Bagnalls first locomotive was produced in 1876, the company going on to produce machines for collieries and overseas plantations. The majority of the products that were manufactured were small four and six-coupled steam locomotives for industrial use, the company were noted for building steam and diesel locomotives in standard and narrow gauges.  In 1891 Ernest Edwin Baguley joined the company, he left in 1902 to start his own business.\n\nBagnalls introduced several novel type of locomotive valve gear including the Bagnall-Price and the Baguley.  They also used marine (circular) fireboxes on narrow gauge engines, a design that was cheap but needed a different firing technique.  Some of the designs of Kerr, Stuart and Co were brought to Bagnalls when they employed William Sydney Edwards, the Chief Draughtsman of Kerr Stuart and Co.  Examples of such locomotives can be seen on the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Light Railway.  In addition to locomotives, Bagnalls constructed rolling stock and trackwork enabling the complete equipping of light railways.  In 1933 Bagnalls entered into an agreement with Deutz of Germany to manufacture their locomotives under licence using engines imported from Germany.  In 1948 WG Bagnall Ltd was sold to the Bridge and Steelwork Company, Heenan and Froude, whose owner also owned The Brush Electrical Engineering Co Ltd of Loughborough and in 1951, Bagnalls formed an association with Brush to create Brush-Bagnall Traction Ltd.
